# blech_clust

Python and R based code for clustering and sorting electrophysiology data recorded using the Intan RHD2132 chips. 
Originally written for cortical multi-electrode recordings in Don Katz's lab at Brandeis. 
Optimized for the High performance computing cluster at Brandeis (https://kb.brandeis.edu/display/SCI/High+Performance+Computing+Cluster) but can be easily modified to work in any parallel environment. Visit the Katz lab website at https://sites.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/katzlab/
